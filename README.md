<h2>About This Dataset:</h2>
<p>This dataset contains comprehensive details of 1000 users from diverse backgrounds, along with their bike purchasing behavior. The dataset serves as a valuable resource for conducting exploratory data analysis and building predictive models using machine learning algorithms. It offers insights into the factors influencing bike purchases and includes injected NA values to simulate real-world data challenges. Through data cleaning, exploration, and visualization, this dataset enables researchers and data enthusiasts to uncover meaningful patterns and trends.</p>

<h2>Scenario:</h2>
<p>Imagine you are a data scientist tasked with analyzing consumer behavior related to bike purchases. By utilizing this dataset, you can gain deep insights into the various factors that impact bike buying decisions. Through careful exploration and visualization, you can identify key trends, correlations, and potential outliers. Furthermore, you can employ machine learning algorithms to predict whether a user is likely to purchase a bike based on their characteristics and background information. This scenario allows you to showcase your data analysis skills and develop predictive models that can inform marketing strategies or business decisions.</p>

<h2>The Dataset Columns:</h2>
<p>ID: Unique identifier for each user.<br>
Marital Status: The marital status of the user (e.g., Married, Single, Divorced).<br>
Gender: The gender of the user (e.g., Male, Female).<br>
Income: The income level of the user.<br>
Children: The number of children the user has.<br>
Education: The educational background of the user.<br>
Occupation: The occupation of the user.<br>
Home Owner: Indicates whether the user owns a home (Yes/No).<br>
Cars: The number of cars owned by the user.<br>
Commute Distance: The distance the user commutes regularly.<br>
Region: The geographical region of the user.<br>
Age: The age of the user.<br>
Purchased Bike: Binary indicator of whether the user purchased a bike (Yes/No).</p>

<h2>Cleaning and Transformation:</h2>
<p>First, cleaning and transformation had to be done on Excel. In order to present a workable dataset, I dealt with the following:<br>
1. Null values<br>
2. Duplicate rows<br>
3. Renamed Column<br>
The cleaned dataset was also done in Excel for transformation.<br>
1. Conditional Column for Age Group<br>
2. Sort column 'Commute Distance' by Changing 10+ Miles to More Than 10 Miles</p>

<h2>Visualization:</h2>
<p>Initially, the focus was on income disparities between male and female bike purchasers versus non-purchasers. Both genders showed higher incomes on average among buyers. Males consistently had slightly higher average incomes than females. Age-wise, middle-aged individuals made the most bike purchases, followed by older and then youth groups. However, considering the age distribution within the overall population was highlighted for better insights.<br>
Regarding travel distances, bike purchases were highest for 0-1 mile distances, followed by 2-5 miles. Purchases decreased as distances increased. The analysis shifted to comparing usage between casual customers and members. Ride distributions, bike types, and customer categories were explored across quarters. Daily ride counts for each type and their preferences for bike types were examined. Lastly, average time spent and favored bike types for each customer type were investigated. This approach provided a comprehensive view of customer behaviors and preferences.</p>
